Exercise: Haberdashery

A haberdashery sells beads and sequins wholesale through its website.
Since it operates as a wholesale business, it requests the number of packages per order and,
depending on this, applies the following rules:

If the number of products is less than 5:
- A message must be displayed indicating that purchases of fewer than 5 products are not allowed.

If the number of products is greater than or equal to 5 but less than or equal to 15:
- A message must be displayed stating that the shipping cost is $10 USD.

If the number of products is greater than 15:
- A message must be displayed indicating that shipping is free.

Create the program necessary to implement the three rules mentioned above.
